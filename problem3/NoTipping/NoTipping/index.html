<h1 align="center">The NoTipping Game</h1>
<h2 align="justify">Instructions for Architect</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p align="justify">You will have to download the game which is a jar file
  <a href="notippingapp.jar">here</a>.</li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify">It contains a file PlayerInfo.txt which you must modify to 
  use the ports of your players.</li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify">Now each player should be having an assigned port, so that 
  when you select the player, the game tries to connect to him or her.</li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify">ReMake the jar file by &quot;jar cvfm notippingapp.jar 
  manifest.txt *.class *.java PlayerInfo.txt&quot;.</li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify">When running the program, specify hostname=localhost to 
  connect to the ports on your local machine. This is useful for testing. 
  specify any other hostname to connect to machines on which the competition is 
  being held.</li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify">Another argument is nodelay=true, this speeds up the game 
  by avoiding the smooth movements of weights and just drops them in place.</li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify">So, to run the application, something like &quot;java -jar 
  notippingapp.jar hostname=localhost&quot; should be enough.</li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify">First select the second player, then the first player and 
  then click on Connect. Red always goes first, so select the blue player first.</li>
</ul>
<h2 align="justify">Instructions for Player</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p align="justify">You will have to download the framework for your player
  <a href="playerclient.tar.gz">here</a>.</li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify">It contains a file NoTippingPlayer.java which you must 
  extend. A sample Contestant.java file is provided which allows you to play by 
  command line instruction is provided.</li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify">To run the player, run it on the machine to which the 
  application run by the architect will connect.</li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify">Something like &quot;java Contestant 8080&quot; would run your 
  program on port 8080.</li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify">If the application (client) disconnects the connection to 
  your player (server), the application exits.</li>
</ul>
<h2 align="justify">Interface Instructions for Player and Architect</h2>
<p align="justify">The application sends the state as a set of lines in the 
following form :-</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p align="justify">The phase which is either &quot;ADDING&quot; or &quot;REMOVING&quot;,</li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify">followed by lines containing &quot;place position color weight&quot;.</li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify">Place is 0 for the sky, 1 for the board and 2 for the 
  grass.</li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify">Position is meaningful for weights on board, otherwise 
  ignore it.</li>
</ul>
<p align="justify">The player sends a move in the following form :-</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p align="justify">A line containing &quot;position weight&quot;.</li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify">In the adding phase, it indicates which weight you want to 
  move where.</li>
  <li>
  <p align="justify">In the removing phase, it indicates which weight is removed 
  from where.</li>
</ul>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
